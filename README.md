# r_dump
Purpose:
This was originally just a dump in a script of all the things I learnt about R throughout my career. The intent was (and still is) just to keep a succinct record so that I had a reference to come back to. I was later asked to teach my friend how to use R, so added to the same doc that beginner foundations.  Over time I've started adding superfluous thoughts as I've been too busy to research into r like I used to, so they're a good reference to pick up from when things free up.

Note regarding the sources:
I found stackoverflow was a good resource to solve specific problems, but not really to learn about the language as a whole or good practice for broad areas. So I started reading a lot of spatial blogs about changes to packages and within the spatial landscape. In turn I became less interested in the spatial side and more in the language as a whole, so I read a lot of online books people wrote to provide advice. Therefore, none of this is my own content.

Notes for Absolute Beginners:
Once you've installed R and RStudio, just use the inbuilt tutorials to learn R. It eases you into it more than flicking between some random blog. I recommend typing below into the console (bottom left panel), and following along in the Console:

>install.packages("swirl")

>library(swirl)

>swirl()
